    <p class="continue">You see there is a lightning storm conveniently forming far to your left and decide it’s a good idea to go towards the lighting so you can bring back a started fire. As you get closer you see a tree fallen over where lighting has struck and there is a small fire at its base. You hurry over as it’s starting to rain pretty heavily and you don’t want the fire to be put out. </p>
